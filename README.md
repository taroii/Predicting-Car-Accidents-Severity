#### 1. **Description**

For this project, we are tasked with predicting the severity of car accidents (mild or severe) in the United States using a country-wide car accident dataset.   

#### 2. **Dataset**

The accident data are collected from February 2016 to Dec 2021, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 2.8 million accident records in this dataset.  

The dataset consists of a mix of 45 numerical and categorical predictors and a categorical response variable called "Severity". We are free to import other datasets to improve our predictions.
